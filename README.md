## Project
###  The Development of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Using Machine Learning Techniques
![depositphotos_671966926-stock-photo-women-using-laptop-computers-digital](https://github.com/ShawhinT/example-portfolio/assets/168281515/2b584e58-d51f-4700-9c54-953bce54e4dd)

This project aims to design and implement a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) utilizing machine learning methodologies to identify and classify potentially malicious network activities. The NIDS will operate in real-time, analyzing network traffic and issuing alerts for any suspicious or harmful behavior detected. The project encompasses several stages, including data collection, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Key Components of the Data Collection:
Acquire network traffic data from diverse sources, such as packet captures (PCAP) obtained from network traffic or network flow data from routers and switches.

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
Extract pertinent features from the raw network traffic data, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, protocol types, packet sizes, and timestamps.
Execute preprocessing tasks such as normalization and feature scaling to enhance data quality.

Model Training:
Employ machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to train models using labeled datasets of both normal and malicious network traffic.
Experiment with various algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

Real-Time Analysis:
Develop a real-time network traffic monitoring system capable of processing incoming packets and inputting them into trained machine learning models for classification.
Generate alerts for any anomalies or suspicious activities detected during the analysis.

Alerting and Reporting:
Establish a mechanism to manage alerts generated by the NIDS, including notification of administrators or security personnel.
Generate comprehensive reports summarizing detected incidents and their severity for further analysis.

Evaluation and Testing:
Evaluate the performance of the NIDS using diverse metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Test the system against various types of attacks, including both known and novel threats, to assess its effectiveness and resilience.
Deployment and Integration:
Deploy the NIDS in either a production environment or simulated network setting.
Integrate the system with existing security infrastructure, including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, to bolster overall network security.
